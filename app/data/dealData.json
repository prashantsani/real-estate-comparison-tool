  "dealSummary": "280 Richards, fully leased to Amazon, aligns with HUSPP's strategy of acquiring prime logistics assets in Brooklyn's high-demand Red Hook submarket. With 13 years remaining on the lease and 3% annual rent escalations, it offers stable, long-term cash flow. While single-tenant exposure is a risk, Amazon's investment-grade rating and renewal options enhance its resilience, making it a strong addition to HUSPP's portfolio.",
